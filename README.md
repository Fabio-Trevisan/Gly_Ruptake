# Gly_Reuptake

Abstract
Background: Phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) deficiencies are relevant plants nutritional disorders, prompting responses such as increased root exudation to aid nutrient uptake, albeit at an energy cost. Reacquiring and reusing exudates could represent an efficient energy and nitrogen saving strategy. Hence, we investigated the impact of plant development, Fe and P deficiencies on this process. Tomato seedlings were grown hydroponically for 3 weeks in Control, -Fe, and -P conditions and sampled twice a week. We used Isotope Ratio Mass-Spectrometry to measure δ13C in roots and shoots after a 2-h exposure to 13C-labeled glycine (0, 50, or 500 μmol L− 1). Plant physiology was assessed with an InfraRed Gas Analyzer and ionome with an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass-Spectrometry.
Results: Glycine uptake varied with concentration, suggesting an involvement of root transporters with different substrate affinities. The uptake decreased over time, with -Fe and -P showing significantly higher values as compared to the Control. This highlights its importance during germination and in nutrient-deficient plants. Translocation to shoots declined over time in -P and Control but increased in -Fe plants, suggesting a role of Gly in the Fe xylem transport.
Conclusions: Root exudates, i.e. glycine, acquisition and their subsequent shoot translocation depend on Fe and P deficiency. The present findings highlight the importance of this adaptation to nutrient deficiencies, that can potentially enhance plants fitness. A thorough comprehension of this trait holds potential significance for selecting cultivars that can better withstand abiotic stresses.
